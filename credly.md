# Quantum Explorers Digital Credentials

Quantum Explorers is our self-paced, game-based quantum computing learning program for high school students and above. There are seven themed achievements to unlock. Each achievement has a learning module, event, or set of tasks associated with it that must be completed in order to unlock its achievement. Based on the number of achievements a learner unlocks, they will be issued an IBM digital credential.
